# PathFinding_Visualizer

## Introduction

Path finding algorithms plays a vital role in our daily life such as packets in computer networks , google maps uses a path finding algorthm to find the shortest path. So this project main idea is to visualize this path finding algorthms using react with the help of some css animations.

## Algorithm used for shortest path

### Dijkstra

- Dijkstra's Algorithm lets us prioritize which paths to explore. Instead of exploring all possible paths equally, it favors lower cost paths.
- It is the algorithm of choice for finding the shortest path paths with multiple destinations.
